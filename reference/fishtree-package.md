# fishtree: Interface to the Fish Tree of Life API

fishtree makes it easy to access phylogenetic information about
ray-finned fishes with R. Download taxonomies, phylogenies, sequence
matrices, and diversification rate data with a simple set of functions.

## Details

Implementation note: this package makes calls over the network and
caches its (sometimes large) results for faster loading. Because of
this, long-running R instances could use a lot of memory.
